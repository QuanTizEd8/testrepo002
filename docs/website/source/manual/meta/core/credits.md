All metadata declaring the authors, funding options, and other credits for your project
are stored in the `core/credits.yaml` file in the repository's `meta` directory.


## Authors
You can declare the core authors of your project, and optionally their roles,
by adding an `author` key to the `core/credits.yaml` file.

### Authors Roles
To assign roles to authors, you must first declare these roles under the `role` key
of the `author` object. The value of the `role` key must be an object,
where the keys are the IDs of the roles (to be assigned to authors),
and the values are objects containing the following keys:
- `title`: The name of the role.
- `description`: A short description of the role.
- `abbreviation`: An abbreviation for the role.

Example:
:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: ðŸ—‚ `./.meta/core/credits.yaml`
author:
  role:
    concept:
      title: Conceptualization
      description: Development of the initial idea for the project.
      abbreviation: CNCPT
    dev:
      title: Software Development
      description: Implementation of the project.
      abbreviation: DEV
    maint:
      title: Maintenance
      description: Maintenance of the project.
      abbreviation: MAINT
:::


### Authors List
To declare the authors of your project, add a key `entries` to the `author` object,
where the value is an array of objects, each declaring a single author.
Each object must contain a key `username` with the GitHub username of the author,
and optionally a key `roles` with the IDs of the roles assigned to the author.

Example:
:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: ðŸ—‚ `./.meta/core/credits.yaml`
author:
  entries:
    - username: ${{ owner.username }}
      roles: [ concept, dev, maint ]
    - username: RepoDynamicsBot
      roles: [ maint ]

## Funding Options
GitHub allows you to add a *Sponsor* button together with a *Sponsor this project* section
to the main page of your repository, to increase the visibility of funding options
for your open-source project. Clicking on the *Sponsor* button opens the *Sponsor this project* section,
where a list of links to your specified funding platforms is displayed to the user.
GitHub lets you specify up to four sponsored GitHub accounts (one of which can be a GitHub organization),
up to four custom URLs,
plus one name (either username, package name, or project name, depending on the platform)
per supported external funding platform (see below).
For more information, see the [About GitHub Sponsors](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors)
and [Displaying a sponsor button in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository)
pages in the [GitHub Sponsors Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors).

All configurations are set under the `funding` key in the `core/credits.yaml` file.
If the file/key is not present (default), this option will be disabled.
If set, the value of the `funding` key must be an object with any number of
the supported key-value pairs (one for each type of platform) described below.

 Example:
```yaml
funding:
   github: [ repodynamics, aariam ]
   tidelift: pypi/PyPackIT
   custom: https://some-custom-funding-platform.com/my-project
```

GitHub looks for a YAML file at `.github/FUNDING.yml` in the default branch of the repository;
If it exists and has the correct format, GitHub will display the
*Sponsor* button and *Sponsor this project* section on the repository's main page,
and will use the information in the file to populate the *Sponsor this project* section,
otherwise, the *Sponsor* button and *Sponsor this project* section will not be displayed.
{{ name }} automatically generates the `.github/FUNDING.yml` file when the `funding` key is set,
and will update/remove the file when the `funding` key is updated/removed.
