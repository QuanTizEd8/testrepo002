# Core Metadata
Core metadata are used to define and describe your project.
They are all stored in a directory named `core`, directly under the repository's `meta` directory,
and are divided into the following categories:

- [**Project Introduction**](intro.md): General information about the project,
such as name, tagline, description, keywords etc.
- [**License and Copyright**](license.md): License and copyright information for the project.
- [**Project Credits**](credits.md): Authors, funding options, and other credits for the project.
