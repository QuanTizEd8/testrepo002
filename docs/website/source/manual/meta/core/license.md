All specifications related to the license and copyright of your project
are stored in the `core/license.yaml` file in the repository's `meta` directory.


## License
It is strongly recommended that you include a license in your project.
To do so, add a `license` key to the `core/license.yaml` file.
You have two options for specifying the license of your project:
- [Specify a pre-defined license](#pre-defined-licenses)
- [Declare any other license](#other-licenses)

### Pre-defined Licenses
To use one of the pre-defined licenses, set a single key, `id`,
to one of the following values (case-insensitive):
- `GNU_AGPL_v3+`: [GNU Affero General Public License v3 or later](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)
- `GNU_AGPL_v3`: [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)
- `GNU_GPL_v3+`: [GNU General Public License v3 or later](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
- `GNU_GPL_v3`: [GNU General Public License v3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
- `MPL_v2`: [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/)
- `Apache_v2`: [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)
- `MIT`: [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
- `BSD_2_Clause`: [BSD 2-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-2-clause/)
- `BSD_3_Clause`: [BSD 3-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/)
- `BSL_v1`: [Boost Software License 1.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsl-1.0/)
- `Unlicense`: [The Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)

For example, to use the GNU AGPL v3+ license:

license:
  id: gnu_agpl_v3+

### Other Licenses
If you want to use any other license not mentioned above, you must instead set the following keys:
- `shortname`: The short name of the license
- `fullname`: The full name of the license
- `text`: The full text of the license
- `notice`: Short license notice
- `trove_classifier` (optional): If your license has a trove classifier,
   and you want it to be automatically added to your package metadata,
   set this to the full text of the license's trove classifier, e.g. `License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License`.

## Copyright
By default, PyPackIT uses the creation date of your repository,
and the name of the repository owner (set in their GitHub account),
to generate a copyright notice, which is used in README files and on your website.
The notice is of the form `{START-YEAR}â€“{CURRENT-YEAR} {OWNER-NAME}` (e.g. `2023â€“2024 John Doe`)
when the repository creation year is not the same as the current year,
and `{CURRENT-YEAR} {OWNER-NAME}` (e.g. `2024 John Doe`) otherwise.
You can customize this notice by setting the following keys under the `copyright` key:
- `year_start`: The start year of the project to use instead of the repository creation year.
- `owner`: The name of the project owner to use instead of the repository owner name.
