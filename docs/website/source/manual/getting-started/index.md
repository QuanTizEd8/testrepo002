# Getting Started
{{pp_meta.name}} can be used for both new and existing projects.
If your project does not yet have a GitHub repository,
follow the instructions under the [Creating a New Repository](#option-1-creating-a-new-repository) section.
Otherwise, if you want to apply {{pp_meta.name}} to an existing repository,
go to the [Integrating an Existing Repository](#option-2-integrating-an-existing-repository) section.
